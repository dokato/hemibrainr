\usage{
flywire_annotations_for_synapses(
  fw.ids,
  partners = NULL,
  db = flywire_neurons(WithConnectors = TRUE),
  keep.dist.nm = 500,
  cleft_scores.thresh = 75,
  sample = 250,
  write.csv = TRUE,
  csv.path = getwd()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fw.ids}{character vector, a vector of valid flywire IDs}

\item{partners}{character vector else not used i \code{NULL}. A vector of
valid flywire IDs for postsynaptic neurons to keep. Synapses to other
postsynaptic targets are filtered out.}

\item{db}{a \code{neuronlist} of flywire neurons with synapses attached}

\item{keep.dist.nm}{numeric, minimum distance in nm that one synapse can be
from another. One random synapse is chosen from groups of proximal
synapses. To deactivate, enter \code{NULL}.}

\item{cleft_scores.thresh}{numeric, cleft_score threshold for synapse
inclusion}

\item{sample}{numeric, the number of synapses to choose from both the
dendrite and axon of each neuron in \code{fw.ids}}

\item{write.csv}{logical, whether or not to write a \code{.csv} output file,
ready for import into flywire. One for each neuron, named by
\code{csv.path}.}

\item{csv.path}{character, the path to which to save \code{.csv} files.}
