\usage{
hemibrain_FAFB_matching(
  bodyids = NULL,
  hemibrain.fafb.nblast = NULL,
  selected_file = "1OSlDtnR3B1LiB5cwI5x5Ql6LkZd8JOS5bBr-HTi0pOw",

}
\arguments{
\item{bodyids}{body IDs for hemibrain neurons present in the
\href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSlDtnR3B1LiB5cwI5x5Ql6LkZd8JOS5bBr-HTi0pOw/edit#gid=0}{Google
 Sheet}, for which the user will attempt to make a match if one has not
been made already.}

\item{hemibrain.fafb.nblast}{a FAFB (rows) - hemibrain (columns) normalised
NBLAST matrix. By default this is read from the flyconnectome Team Drive.}

\item{selected_file}{the Google Sheet database to read and write from. For
now, defaults to a
\href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSlDtnR3B1LiB5cwI5x5Ql6LkZd8JOS5bBr-HTi0pOw/edit#gid=0}{Google
 Sheet for lateral horn neurons}. No other databases have been prepared.}

\item{batch_size}{the number of FAFB top matches to read from CATMAID in one
go.}

\item{db}{Either a neuronlist or the name of a character vector naming a
neuronlist. Defaults to the value of \code{\link{hemibrain_neurons}()}.}

\description{
Match up neurons between the hemibrain and FAFB and save the
  result using a
  \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSlDtnR3B1LiB5cwI5x5Ql6LkZd8JOS5bBr-HTi0pOw/edit#gid=0}{Google
  Sheet} on the hemibrain Google Team Drive operated by the flyconnectome
  group at the University of Cambridge. This function
  only considers lateral horn neurons. You must have access to the Team Drive
  in order to use this function. This function makes use of the Google
  Filestream application, which should be installed on your machine. Further,
  note that neurons are read from the FAFB CATMAID project, and you must have
  log-in details for this project recorded in your .Renviron for this
  function to work.

\details{
Currently, the
  \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSlDtnR3B1LiB5cwI5x5Ql6LkZd8JOS5bBr-HTi0pOw/edit#gid=0}{Google
   Sheet} is set up with  limited number of users, each of whom have been
  assigned a number of neurons to match up. In order to add yourself as a
  user, simply open this Google Sheet in your browser and add your initials
  to neurons of your choosing on the rightmost column 'Users'. Once a match
  is recorded, the user selects a quality for that match. There can be no
  match (n), a poor match (p) an okay match (o) or an exact match (e). As a
  rule of thumb, a poor match could be a neuron from a very similar same cell
  type or a highly untraced neuron that may be the correct cell type. An okay
  match should be a neuron that looks to be from the same morphological cell
  type but there may be some discrepancies in its arbour. An exact match is a
  neuron that corresponds well between FAFB and the hemibrain data.
