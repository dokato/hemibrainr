\arguments{
\item{someneuronlist}{a neuronlist or neuron object that has been modified by flow.centrality.}

\item{col}{colours of sections. Defaults to orange or axons, green for primary dendrite, blue for dendrites and pink for nodes with no flow.}

\item{splitnode}{if TRUE, a magenta sphere is placed at the location of the axon-dendrite split. Possible a putative action potential initiation site?}

\item{WithConnectors}{whether to plot the anatomical location of pre (red) and post (cyan) synapses.}

\item{WithNodes}{whether to plot branch points}

\item{soma}{whether to plot a soma, and what the radius should be. If \code{NULL}, an appropriate value is guessed.}

\item{highflow}{whether to plot the nodes of highest (with in one standard deviation less than maximum) flow centrality (pink points)}

\item{lwd}{Line width (default 1)}

\item{radius}{For connectors and axon-dendrite split node (default 1). If \code{NULL}, an appropriate value is guessed.}

\item{already_selected}{a vector of IDs for neurons that are already considered selected. If \code{NULL} then no neurons are considered selected to start with.}

\item{...}{additional arguments passed to methods.}

\item{Verbose}{logical indicating that info about each selected neuron should be printed (default TRUE)}

\item{Wait}{logical indicating that there should be a pause between each displayed neuron}

\item{sleep}{time to pause between each displayed neuron when Wait=TRUE}

\item{selected_file}{an optional path to a yaml file that already contains a selection}

\item{selected_col}{the color in which selected neurons (such as those specified in selected_file) should be plotted}

\item{yaml}{a logical indicating that selections should be saved to disk in (human-readable) yaml rather than (machine-readable) rda format}
